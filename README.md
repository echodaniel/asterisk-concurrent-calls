# asterisk-concurrent-calls
Creating a simple script for Asterisk to monitor concurrent calls and output to a CSV. Also doing this to learn version control and Github.

File has been tested on local system. Prints output while running the script itself. To monitor calls other than SIP simply replace the section of the script itself that says SIP with DAHDI/PJSIP or whatever type of call/channel you'd like to monitor, I've tested it with all three and it works with those two. Let me know if you test it with something and it works with/without your system! I'd appreciate any feedback.
